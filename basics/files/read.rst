File Read
=========

.. testsetup::

    from pathlib import Path
    Path('/tmp/myfile.txt').unlink(missing_ok=True)
    Path('/tmp/myfile.txt').touch()


Rationale
---------
* Works with both relative and absolute path
* Fails when directory with file cannot be accessed
* Fails when file cannot be accessed
* Uses context manager
* ``mode`` parameter to ``open()`` function is optional (defaults to ``mode='rt'``)


Read From File
--------------
* Always remember to close file

    >>> FILE = r'/tmp/myfile.txt'
    >>>
    >>> file = open(FILE)
    >>> data = file.read()
    >>> file.close()


Read Using Context Manager
--------------------------
* Context managers use ``with ... as ...:`` syntax
* It closes file automatically upon block exit (dedent)
* Using context manager is best practice
* More information in `Protocol Context Manager`

    >>> FILE = r'/tmp/myfile.txt'
    >>>
    >>> with open(FILE) as file:
    ...     data = file.read()


Read File at Once
-----------------
* Note, that whole file must fit into memory

    >>> FILE = r'/tmp/myfile.txt'
    >>>
    >>> with open(FILE) as file:
    ...     data = file.read()


Read File as List of Lines
--------------------------
 * Note, that whole file must fit into memory

    >>> FILE = r'/tmp/myfile.txt'
    >>>
    >>> with open(FILE) as file:
    ...     data = file.readlines()

Read selected (1-30) lines from file:

    >>> FILE = r'/tmp/myfile.txt'
    >>>
    >>> with open(FILE) as file:
    ...     lines = file.readlines()[1:30]

Read selected (1-30) lines from file:

    >>> FILE = r'/tmp/myfile.txt'
    >>>
    >>> with open(FILE) as file:
    ...     for line in file.readlines()[1:30]:
    ...         print(line)

Read whole file and split by lines, separate header from content:

    >>> FILE = r'/tmp/myfile.txt'
    >>>
    >>> # doctest: +SKIP
    ... with open(FILE) as file:
    ...     header, *content = file.readlines()
    ...
    ...     for line in content:
    ...         print(line)


Reading File as Generator
-------------------------
* Use generator to iterate over other lines
* In those examples, ``file`` is a generator

    >>> FILE = r'/tmp/myfile.txt'
    >>>
    >>> with open(FILE) as file:
    ...     for line in file:
    ...         print(line)

    >>> FILE = r'/tmp/myfile.txt'
    >>>
    >>> with open(FILE) as file:
    ...     header = file.readline()
    ...
    ...     for line in file:
    ...         print(line)


Examples
--------
    >>> def isnumeric(x):
    ...     try:
    ...         float(x)
    ...         return True
    ...     except ValueError:
    ...         return False
    >>>
    >>>
    >>> def clean(line):
    ...     line = line.strip().split(',')
    ...     line = map(lambda x: float(x) if isnumeric(x) else x, line)
    ...     return tuple(line)
    >>>
    >>>
    >>> with open(FILE) as file:
    ...     header = clean(file.readline())
    ...
    ...     for line in file:
    ...         line = clean(line)
    ...         print(line)

    >>> total = 0
    >>>
    >>> with open(FILE) as file:
    ...    for line in file:
    ...        total += sum(float(line))
    >>>
    >>> print(total)
    0
