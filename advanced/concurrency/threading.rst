Daemon
------
* https://stackoverflow.com/a/190017/228517

Some threads do background tasks, like sending keepalive packets, or performing periodic garbage collection, or whatever. These are only useful when the main program is running, and it's okay to kill them off once the other, non-daemon, threads have exited.

Without daemon threads, you'd have to keep track of them, and tell them to exit, before your program can completely quit. By setting them as daemon threads, you can let them run and forget about them, and when your program quits, any daemon threads are killed automatically.


Delay execution
---------------
* dlaczego nie ``time.sleep()``
* rekurencyjny timer

Delay execution:

.. code-block:: python

    from threading import Timer


    DELAY_SECONDS = 5.0

    def hello():
        print('Hello world!')


    t = Timer(DELAY_SECONDS, hello)
    t.start()

    print('Main Thread')

Recurrent timer:

.. code-block:: python

    from threading import Timer


    DELAY_SECONDS = 5.0

    def hello():
        print('Timer Thread')
        Timer(DELAY_SECONDS, hello).start()


    t = Timer(DELAY_SECONDS, hello)
    t.start()

    print('Main Thread')


Creating Threads
----------------
.. code-block:: python

    from threading import Thread


    class MyThread(Thread):
        def run(self):
            print('hello')


    t = MyThread()
    t.start()


Thread Synchronisation
----------------------
.. code-block:: python

    from threading import Thread


    class MyThread(Thread):
        def run(self):
            print('hello')


    t1 = MyThread()
    t1.start()

    t2 = MyThread()
    t2.start()

    t1.join()
    t2.join()

.. code-block:: python

    from threading import Thread

    RUNNING = []


    class MyThread(Thread):
        def run(self):
            print('hello')


    t1 = MyThread()
    t1.start()
    RUNNING.append(t1)

    t2 = MyThread()
    t2.start()
    RUNNING.append(t2)

    for thread in RUNNING:
        thread.join()

.. code-block:: python

    from threading import Thread

    RUNNING = []


    class MyThread(Thread):
        def run(self):
            print('hello')


    def spawn(cls, count=1):
        for i in range(count):
            t = cls()
            t.start()
            RUNNING.append(t)


    spawn(MyThread, count=10)


    for thread in RUNNING:
        thread.join()


Joining Threads
---------------
Joining Threads:

.. code-block:: python

    from queue import Queue
    from threading import Thread, Lock
    from time import sleep


    EXIT = False
    LOCK = Lock()
    TODO = Queue()
    RUNNING = []


    class MyThread(Thread):
        def run(self):
            while not EXIT:
                # Remove and return an item from the queue.
                job = TODO.get()

                # Execute work
                print(f'Will do the work: {job}')

                # Indicate that a formerly enqueued task is complete.
                TODO.task_done()
                sleep(1)

            print(f'Exiting {self.name}')


    # Create new threads
    def spawn_worker(count=1):
        for i in range(count):
            thread = MyThread()
            thread.start()
            RUNNING.append(thread)


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        spawn_worker(5)

        # Fill the queue
        with LOCK:
            for task in ['One', 'Two', 'Three', 'Four', 'Five']:
                TODO.put(task)

        # Wait for queue to empty
        while not TODO.empty():
            pass

        # Notify threads it's time to exit
        EXIT = True

        # Wait for all threads to complete
        for thread in RUNNING:
            thread.join()

        print(f'Exiting Main Thread')


Workers
-------
Worker model:

.. code-block:: python

    from queue import Queue
    from threading import Thread

    TODO = Queue()


    class Worker(Thread):
        def run(self):
            while True:
                # Remove and return an item from the queue.
                job = TODO.get()

                # Execute work
                print(f'Will do the work: {job}')

                # Indicate that a formerly enqueued task is complete.
                TODO.task_done()


    def spawn_worker(count=1):
        for i in range(count):
            Worker().start()


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        spawn_worker(3)

        TODO.put('ping')
        TODO.put('ls -la')
        TODO.put('echo "hello world"')
        TODO.put('cat /etc/passwd')

        # wait to complete all tasks
        TODO.join()
