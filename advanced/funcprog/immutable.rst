FuncProg Immutable
==================


Rational
--------
* Mutable: list, set, dict
* Immutable: tuple, frozenset, mappingproxy


Data Structures
---------------
* Purely functional data structures have persistence (keeps previous versions of the data structure unmodified)
* The array with constant access and update times is a basic component of most imperative languages, and many imperative data-structures, such as the hash table and binary heap, are based on arrays
* Arrays can be replaced by maps or random access lists, which admit purely functional implementation, but have logarithmic access and update times
