Generator About
===============


Rationale
---------
* Create generator object and assign pointer (do not execute)
* Comprehensions will be in the memory until end of a program
* Generators are cleared once they are executed
* Comprehensions - Using values more than one
* Generators - Using values once (for example in the loop iterator)

* Generator will calculate next number for every loop iteration
* Generator forgets previous number
* Generator doesn't know the next number

* Code do not execute instantly
* Sometimes code is not executed at all!

* If you need values evaluated instantly, there is no point in using generators
