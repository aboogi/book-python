    normalization
        Database normalization is the process of structuring a database,
        usually a relational database, in accordance with a series of
        so-called normal forms in order to reduce data redundancy and
        improve data integrity. Normalization entails organizing the columns
        (attributes) and tables (relations) of a database to ensure that
        their dependencies are properly enforced by database integrity
        constraints. It is accomplished by applying some formal rules either
        by a process of synthesis (creating a new database design) or
        decomposition (improving an existing database design). A relational
        database relation is often described as 'normalized' if it meets
        third normal form. [#WikipediaDatabaseNormalization]_ [#Codd1972]_
